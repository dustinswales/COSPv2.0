&RTTOV_INPUT
  !-------------- Logical for constructing outputs and determining settings
  Lrttov_bt=.true.,                 ! Calculate RTTOV brightness temps
  Lrttov_rad=.true.,                ! Calculate RTTOV radiances
  Lrttov_refl=.false.,              ! Calculate RTTOV reflectivities
  Lrttov_cld=.false.,                ! Calculate RTTOV all-sky + cloudy-sky values
  Lrttov_aer=.false.,                ! Calculate RTTOV all-sky + cloudy-sky values
  Lrttov_cldparam=.false.,          ! Use user input cloud optical parameters
  Lrttov_aerparam=.false.,          ! Use user input aerosol optical parameters
  Lrttov_pc=.false.,                ! Run with PC-RTTOV
  !-------------- Number of channels to reconstruct. Should match the length of entries in "channel_filepath"
  nchannels_rec=2645, ! 2645 for all AIRS L1C channels, could limit just to those that overlap RRTMG channels
  !-------------- RTTOV Filepaths 
  Lchannel_filepath=.false.,

  CO2_data=.true.,
  CH4_data=.false.,
  ozone_data=.true.,
  clw_data=.false.,        ! Only used for MW calculations
  ! -------------- RTTOV Trace Gas Concentrations
  ! -------------- Specify units in RTTOV options set-up
  ! ---------------Standard units are kg/kg over moist air
